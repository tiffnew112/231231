# Motorcycle Jump Calculation

## Conservation of Energy Equation

The conservation of energy states:

**Initial Potential Energy (when at the top of the cliff) + Initial Kinetic Energy (when at the top of the cliff) = Final Potential Energy (when on the ground) + Final Kinetic Energy (when on the ground)**

We can break this equation down into four parts:

1. Initial Potential Energy (when at the top of the cliff) = \(m \times g \times h_0\)
2. Final Potential Energy (when on the ground) = \(m \times g \times h_1\)
3. Initial Kinetic Energy (when at the top of the cliff) = \(\frac{1}{2} m v_0^2\)
4. Final Kinetic Energy (when on the ground) = \(\frac{1}{2} m v^2\)

## Given Parameters

Given the following parameters:

- \(h_0\) = 70 m
- \(h_1\) = 35 m
- \(v_0\) = 38 m/s
- \(g\) = 9.81 m/s^2

## Calculation

Substituting in our known values into the conservation of energy equation:

\(m \times g \times 70\) + \(\frac{1}{2} m \times 38^2\) = \(m \times g \times 35\) + \(\frac{1}{2} m v^2\)

The mass \(m\) can be canceled out from both sides:

\(g \times 70 + \frac{1}{2} \times 38^2\) = \(g \times 35 + \frac{1}{2} v^2\)

Rearranging to solve for \(v^2\):

\(v^2\) = \(2 \times (g \times 70 + \frac{1}{2} \times 38^2 - g \times 35)\)

Now, we'll compute \(v\):

\(v\) = \(\sqrt{2 \times (9.81 \times 70 + \frac{1}{2} \times 38^2 - 9.81 \times 35)}\)

Plugging in the values and solving:

\(v\) = \(\sqrt{2 \times (686.7 + 722 - 343.35)}\)
= \(\sqrt{2 \times 1065.7}\)
= \(\sqrt{2131.4}\)
= 46.2 m/s

The speed with which the motorcycle strikes the ground on the other side is approximately 46.2 m/s.
