# Physics Problem Solution: Daredevil Motorcyclist Jump

## Problem Description:

A daredevil motorcyclist attempts to jump across a canyon by driving horizontally off a cliff at a speed of 38.0 m/s. Ignoring air resistance, determine the speed with which the motorcycle strikes the ground on the other side.

**Given**:
- Initial horizontal speed: \( v_0 \) = 38.0 m/s
- Initial height: \( h_0 \) = 70.0 m
- Final height: \( h_1 \) = 35.0 m
- Gravitational acceleration: \( g \) = 9.81 m/s^2

## Solution:

Using the principle of conservation of energy:

*Initial Potential Energy + Initial Kinetic Energy = Final Potential Energy + Final Kinetic Energy*

This is given by:

\[ m \cdot g \cdot h_0 + 0.5 \cdot m \cdot v_0^2 = m \cdot g \cdot h_1 + 0.5 \cdot m \cdot v^2 \]

By canceling out the mass, m, and rearranging for v:

\[ v = \sqrt{2 \times (g \times h_0 + 0.5 \times v_0^2 - g \times h_1)} \]

Plugging in the given values:

\[ v = \sqrt{2 \times (9.81 \times 70 + 0.5 \times 38^2 - 9.81 \times 35)} \]

This results in:

\[ v \approx 46.2 \text{m/s} \]

## Conclusion:

The speed with which the motorcycle strikes the ground on the other side is approximately 46.2 m/s.

This format should render correctly in any standard markdown environment. If you're copying this into a platform that supports LaTeX rendering, such as GitHub, the mathematical expressions enclosed within \( \) will render as inline equations. If not, you may need to adjust the mathematical notations accordingly.
